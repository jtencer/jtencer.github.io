### Abstract

Several of the most popular deterministic radiation transport methods for heat transfer are compared. Relative solution error is compared as a function of optical thickness and scattering albedo. The test problems are chosen to represent a range of problem types. Problems with discontinuous boundary conditions are included to evaluate ‘ray effects’ for discrete ordinates solutions. A brief derivation and a statement of the governing equations for each method is included so that the details of the precise method used is clear. All solutions are generated using finite element discretization. Where applicable, any stabilization used is included in the statement of the governing equations.
