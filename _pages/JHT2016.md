### Abstract

The discrete ordinates method is a popular and versatile technique for solving the radiative transport equation, a major drawback of which is the presence of ray effects. Mitigation of ray effects can yield significantly more accurate results and enhanced numerical stability for combined mode codes. When ray effects are present, the solution is seen to be highly dependent upon the relative orientation of the geometry and the global reference frame. This is an undesirable property. A novel ray effect mitigation technique of averaging the computed solution for various reference frame orientations is proposed.
