### Abstract

In this work, we revisit the classic problem of site percolation on a regular square lattice. In particular, we investigate the effect of quantization bias errors on percolation threshold predictions for large probability gradients and propose a mitigation strategy. We demonstrate through extensive computational experiments that the assumption of a linear relationship between probability gradient and percolation threshold used in previous investigations is invalid. Moreover, we demonstrate that, due to skewness in the distribution of occupation probabilities visited the average does not converge monotonically to the true percolation threshold. We identify several alternative metrics which do exhibit monotonic (albeit not linear) convergence and document their observed convergence rates.
